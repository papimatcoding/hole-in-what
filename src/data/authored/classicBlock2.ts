/**
 * Classic chapter 2.
 *
 * Chapter 1 ends on C10 as an exam. C11 intentionally resets the mental load to teach a new
 * surface, but it must not reset all the way back to tutorial difficulty. Chapter-2 geometry uses
 * broad doglegs rather than narrow gaps: the goal is to require placement without taxing touch
 * precision, and specifically to stop wall-bank HIOs from bypassing the new mechanics.

// 11 — First ice lesson. Alternating L-gates require a real setup before the cup while leaving

// collision geometry, so the player learns extra carry and then gets grass for the final approach.
